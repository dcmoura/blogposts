## Freeing the data scientist mind from the curse of vectoRization - Julia to the rescue!

Data Scientists learned to avoid loops and recursion because they make Python/R code slow. Let me show you how Julia sets you free from these constraints.

## R vs Python vs Julia - How easy it is to write efficient code?

Python is the languange of choice of most data scientists, followed by R. Julia is the new kid on the block that promisses C-like performance. How do these languages compare when you need to write efficient algorithms?

## Command-line data analytics made easy

The command-line is incredibly powerful when it comes to data processing. Still, many of us working with data do not take advantage of it. 
In this post I show how [SPyQL - SQL with Python in the middle](https://github.com/dcmoura/spyql) simplifies querying data from the command-line.
